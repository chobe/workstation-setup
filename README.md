  <h1>Workstation Setup</h1>
</div>

Configure a workstation with Ansible (Only Ubuntu is supported). I created this repository inspired by the course [Developer Productivity](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/developer-productivity/) and the configuration of [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/ansible). I just copy and paste while I learn

## Installation

```bash
wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chobe/workstation-setup/main/run-setup | bash
```
